Compression 
    is the act of taking data and
    encoding it (changing its form) in such a way that it takes up less space. 

Decompression
    is reversing the process, returning the data to its original form.


If it is more storage-efficient to compress data, then why is all data not compressed?
There is a tradeoff between time and space. It takes time to compress a piece
of data and to decompress it back into its original form. Therefore, data compression
only makes sense in situations where small size is prioritized over fast execution.


The easiest data compression wins come about when you realize that data storage
types use more bits than are strictly required for their contents.
